# magnetic-levitaion-state-space-controller
This depicts a Matlab designed state feed back controller design, for a ball suspension system using magnetic levitaion.

Design of a state feedback controller for a magnetic ball suspension system, achieving a position deviation of less than 
0.055m, and a settling time of 0.45 sec, with constraints on poles of controller and observer, using Simulink.
